"This letter is to raise concern about service I recently received from a Key Bank XXXX branch. I was cold called even though I am on the do not call list on approximately XX/XX/2016 by a Key Bank XXXX employee and was offered a personal loan for credit card consolidation in the amount of $ XXXX My wife and I discussed it for several days and decided to submit the application and speed up our process on becoming debt fee from 10+ years down to 5 years according to the verbal offer made on the phone. On XX/XX/2016 we submitted the application. We were denied the loan even though we met the banks pre-approval criteria. We were then offered a contingent loan if we refinanced our auto loan through them with a lower monthly payment. The existing loan was to be paid off approximately XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX of this year and was at a .9 % interest rate. The wife and I again discussed the options and decided that even though the term would reset the timeline to five years and increase the interest rate to 4.69 % from .9 % interest rate, including loan origination and paperwork fees it would be less than wat we are paying in interest for the credit cards in the long run with the closing of the personal loan that was promised. During the auto loan closing process we were again reassured that everything would be fine and the personal loan would be approved upon the completion of the auto loan. Once we completed the auto loan process our credit was ran for the third time and we then were told the underwriter denied / revoked the original contingent offer even though we met the Banks pre-approval guidelines. At this time our credit had been ran three times affecting our credit score greatly, the Branch manager then offered to close a loan in the amount of {$15000.00} when we returned from a memorial service the following week. We then said ok it 's better than nothing. I called on XX/XX/XXXX to set up the closing the Branch manager then stated we had to wait another 30 days to run credit again when implying on the phone that we would just be modifying the terms with no further credit pulls. At this time I stated they are not going to run my credit for the fourth time and they needed to honor the original contingent offer. The branch manager then stated he would see what he can do. After calling the branch for several days asking for updates finally the Branch manager responded with there is nothing we can do. At this time I feel that several violations have occurred and are as follows but not limited to, do not call list violation, Bait and Switch, False advertising, revocation of a written and verbal agreement altering a financial situation for the worse, and potentially more. In conclusion my wife and I did not go looking for this situation the Bank came to us to help us better our financial situation, however quite the opposite has happened. The bank has greatly altered my financial situation negatively by negatively affecting our credit score and making potently harder for future loans or lines of credit, further raising our percentage rate on the auto loan while also now adding loan origination and paper work fees with prepayment penalties if we pay the loan of early as planned. If we would have allowed the Bank to continue to pull our credit over and over they would have. Furthermore when we raised question as to some of the denial reasons they were then changed to fit the needs of the bank such as insufficient credit file, we have over 20years of credit file, and insufficient liquidity. Liquidity was not even discussed and they have no idea what I have in other banks and retirement institutions.. How can we continue to trust this institution after what has happened with no remedy offered.",Consumer Loan

"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a personal loan from the XXXX XXXX, XXXX branch of XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, my wife and I filed Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy which included that loan. The bankruptcy was completed on XX/XX/XXXX, and the loan is being properly listed on my credit report as Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy. 

However there is another loan listed on my credit report under Mariner Finance. It was also reportedly issued on XX/XX/XXXX, with a last payment made date of XX/XX/XXXX, the exact dates reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX. This loan is being reported as Unpaid Balance Charged Off. I have never applied for or received a loan from Mariner Finance, and certainly did not apply for or receive two entirely different loans on XX/XX/XXXX, as is currently claimed on my credit report. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX merged with Mariner Finance , LLC and on XX/XX/XXXX, the company became known as Mariner Finance. It appears that sometime between the merger and the final discharge of the debt, the account was transferred from XXXX XXXX XXXX to Mariner Finance, resulting in a new account number. That doesn't make it a new loan or change the fact it was XXXX, however. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted an online dispute with XXXX, identifying the duplication and noting this was likely the same loan reported twice. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a reply claiming the accounts were verified as accurate. I'm not sure how it was verified, but someone, somewhere, is mistaken. 

I contacted the main office of Mariner Finance on XX/XX/XXXX, to correct this error. I spoke with XXXX and explained the problem, and was transferred to XXXX at the XXXX XXXX, XXXX branch. After I explained again, XXXX told me that her manager, XXXX, was out of the office but would return my call the following day. On the XXXX, my wife spoke with XXXX, and explained the situation yet again. He stated repeatedly there was nothing he could do and claimed if XXXX was saying it was verified, then it must be accurate. He suggested we contact an attorney if we had further questions.

My attempts to communicate with the loan officer and loan processor since signing the Intent to Proceed have been largely unsuccessful resulting in missed deadlines and a failure to meet the original closing date. Between XX/XX/19 and XX/XX/19, I sent 6 emails to my loan officer and/or loan processor and not a single one was replied to. Over the same approximate 1-month period, I left 11 voicemail phone messages ( no phone calls were ever answered immediately ). Only three of my calls were returned.

Due to lender 's failure to respond to my attempted outreach, at no time was I aware if the submitted documentation would be acceptable. 

The conditional loan approval correctly stated the closing date XX/XX/19. An initial closing disclosure is required by XX/XX/19 in order to close by XX/XX/19. TD Bank did not meet the XX/XX/19 deadline for the closing disclosure. I was informed via email onXX/XX/19( the first email response I received since XX/XX/19 ) that the lender has not performed an employment verification. I was informed by TD Bank that a written verification request was sent to my employer on XX/XX/19, the day the closing disclosure was due. During one of the few successful phone calls on XX/XX/19, I asked the loan processor if any documentation was needed for employment verification. I was informed TD Bank would independently obtain the verification. As of XX/XX/19, to my knowledge the only item which is required to complete underwriting is the written employment verification. However, I can not confirm this is the only requirement for underwriting due to the lack of communication. As of the filing of this complaint, I have not received the completed appraisal, the initial closing disclosure, or even a proposed revised closing date. 

TD Bank has failed to display any good-faith efforts indicating that they attempted to close this loan on-time. Outreaches to the TD Bank loan officer and processor have been almost nonexistent. Outreach to TD Banks customer service line has been successful, however, the amount of assistance they can provide me in limited to what is recorded in the system by the loan officer or processor.

"In XXXX, I owed {$38000.00} on my house when I left chapter XXXX bankruptcy. Under advice of my attorney, I did not reaffirm the loan due to house not being worth the loan value. Over the next couple of years, I tried to negotiate with XXXX  XXXX XXXX to keep my house. I filled out several loan modification applications and submitted them to the bank. In XXXX, I hired an attorney to assist with the loan modification process because of their constantly making me redo the application. That same year XXXX  XXXX XXXX foreclosed on my property and during the foreclosure they transferred the loan to Green Tree Servicing. My attorney submitted the application to Green Tree several times and in XXXX, they denied my application. My attorney advised me that Judge XXXX had setup a portal to monitor the banks handling of the process and I was forced back into bankruptcy. We had to make trial payments before being accepted into the process and on XX/XX/XXXX I signed the modification. 

At this same time The FTC entered into a settlement agreement with Green Tree which was signed on or about XX/XX/XXXX. In this agreement Green Tree entered into settlement in part for Green Trees misrepresentation of inaccurate amounts reported against loans they serviced. On XX/XX/XXXX, Green Tree signed the modification and increased my loan from {$38000.00} to {$59000.00}. 

I have not received any money from the settlement even though servicing of my loan by Green Tree fell within that time period during foreclosure they did not honor the in-process loan modification from XXXX  XXXX XXXX. 

We continued to struggle, and we had to have the loan modified again. Our loan was now being handled by Ditech and on XX/XX/XXXX the new modified agreement was increased to {$62.00}, XXXX. 

During the whole time we tried to get Green Tree and/or Ditech to explain why this extra money was added to our account. On XX/XX/XXXX of this year, I had to let the house go and I signed a deed in lieu of foreclosure. When I signed the papers, I was upset because I bought this house when I was XXXX years old and lived in for over 30 years.. I asked for copy of notarized paperwork from the notary who told me that he was under orders not to give me a copy. To date, ditech has never sent me a copy. 
In XXXX, Ditech filed foreclosure against me with my loan now being {$68000.00}. I filed a counter claim against Ditech ( see attachments ). On XX/XX/XXXX I received notice from one of Ditechs attorneys that I have no right to sue for Ditech misrepresenting money owed on my loan and/or previous violations of the FTC settlement which they have intentionally ignored and misrepresented amount of my loan plus reported these inaccurate amounts on my credit report. 

In Summary, when I left bankruptcy in XXXX the loan was {$38000.00}. The court would not approve the amount as it was higher than the actual value of {$20.00} - {$25000.00}. Instead Green Tree/ Ditech have used the loan modification process to obtain more than my loan was valued and more than the bankruptcy court would allow to reaffirm the loan. Furthermore, the Hamp program was offered to consumers to save their home which included the following provisions : 1.  Reduce Mortgage Principal 2. Reduce Interest Rate 3. Temporarily postpone or offer forbearance 4. Extend terms of current loan On XXXX of XXXX, XXXX XXXX   made available to consumers principal reduction modification which I would have been eligible for in the second modification but was never offered in my second loan modification. 

Despite knowledge of the requirements imposed through the Consent Order that was settled on XX/XX/XXXX, Green Tree - Ditech have continued to defrauding consumers by : 1. False representation of amount owed on my property through the loan modifications 2. Failure to abide by the order and issue money to me in accordance with the settlement 3. False or inaccurate information being reported on my credit report 4. Not abiding by modification rules to reduce principal Finally they have misrepresented to the bankruptcy court that they are acting in good faith but they are using the court to cause willful and malicious injury to the consumer by not allowing them due process in filing counter claims to preserve their rights to sue for damages arising out of their continued and willful violation of the Consent Order signed with the FTC on XX/XX/XXXX.

"My loan was originally with Benchmark Home Loans. My loan was sold in approximately XX/XX/XXXX, and Mr. Cooper became my new mortgage servicer. Prior to Mr. Cooper becoming my mortgage servicer, I placed my homeowners insurance with XXXX XXXX XXXX Mr. Cooper has been receiving mortgage payments along with payments into an escrow account to pay my insurance renewal. 

My homeowners insurance renewal bill was issued by XXXX XXXX XXXX Mr. Cooper did not issue a check to pay the preium XXXX per their own admission. My premium payment was due XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, my premium was 8 days overdue with XXXX and they advised they had not received payment from Mr. Cooper. Therefore, I was forced to pay my homeowners insurance premium in the amount of {$2000.00} in full to avoid my policy being rescinded/cancelled for non-payment of premium. 

I pay into an escrow account and expect my mortgage servicer to promptly pay taxes and insurance bills. Mr. Cooper failed to pay my insurance bill timely, which could have resulted in a significant exposure by having my insurance rescinded, leading to higher premiums with less coverage. I have also had to previously remind them to pay my county tax bill to avoid penalties. Further, Mr. Cooper 's recent data breach has exposed my personal information. Mr. Cooper is failing to promptly service my escrow account and does not appear to be taking appropriate action to protect my interests.",Mortgage

"My XX/XX/XXXX taxes which are escrowed were not paid according to my legal signed wishes. I was told i didn't send in my Wisconsin Escrow Option, which in essence was signed during my closing on XX/XX/XXXX. After I contacted them after realizing I had not received a receipt like I normally do that is what I was told. I was then told to send in my copy of the document, which they should have had on file, it was part of my closing documents, everything else got updated accordingly, my mortgage statements come and get paid. I did that and send it to the research department. I did that and I received a letter dated XX/XX/19 stating that they did not receive a copy in time and they defaulted me to option 3, which states : The Lender will pay the property taxes when due from my escrow account. I selected option 2 : The Lender will pay the property taxes from my escrow account by by XX/XX/XXXX ... with other parameters to do so. My document is legal and binding just as every other document that I signed to refinance my loan, I feel just we are sorry you are not happy with your experience is not enough. I feel they are very callous and really unconcerned, still didn't opt to my chosen option even after providing them with the document they should have had on file. I had to call in to find out no, they didn't do anything to get the payment in and also had chose still the default option. The customer service rep updated to my option 2, upon me calling me. This is unacceptable and I want it reported, I have to suffer for my XX/XX/XXXX non payment of property taxes for filing my XX/XX/XXXX taxes now ...",Mortgage
"On XX/XX/XXXX I requested the removal of Private Mortgage Insurance from my loan, from which lender PennyMac requested an Appraisal. 
The appraisal showed the LTV was less than required 80 %, and they proceed and removed the PMI payment from my monthly payment After Escrow account revision done in XX/XX/XXXX, I did not agree with the terms and requested de deletion of Escrow Account. 
Lender requested the payment of the shortage for the time of the request, which I made the same day, for an amount of {$5500.00}. 
After payment was reflected in my account I called again and requested the Escrow deletion, which they processed. 2 Weeks later I received a Denial letter saying that an loan to value ( LTV ) ratio was not met, which is not true as they do have the latest Property appraisal which shows less than 80 % of LTV ; and they used it to remove the PMI payment. 
I need all Escrows payments removed as I comply with all requirements for it.",Mortgage
"Umpqua Bank did not provide the required escrow analysis for our loan XXXX the XXXX billing statement ( XXXX ). They stated that they were "" having issues with their vender '', so none of their customers received a XXXX statement or escrow shortage Disclosure statement.

I noticed the increased payments on XX/XX/XXXX when I went to make my XX/XX/XXXX payment. 

I had to call several times to receive the verbal response of, "" your payments were adjusted due to an escrow shortage for taxes and insurance ''. I informed them that they must adjust my payments back to where they were until they've provided the required written notice so that I can pay the shortage in cash, if I so choose, only to be transferred to bank supervisors that were not in the mortgage department and had no knowledge and/or access to the mortgage department. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I finally got someone to email me the required notice as they stated, "" these notices should be mailing out to all our customers shortly ''. I have made the escrow shortage payment, and requested my payments be adjusted as the law required, but no reconciliation or adjustments have been acknowledged or adjusted by Umpqua Bank. 

My husband and I have XXXX mortgages with Umpqua Bank and they were both adjusted without the required written notice. Based on the response, I received on this issue, every mortgage within Umpqua Bank XXXX has been adjusted without proper disclosure.",Mortgage
"Wells Fargo offers various rate discounts to their jumbo loan products by selling a deposit account from {$250000.00} - $ XXXX. 

Wells Fargo agents are trained by their direct managers to suggest moving the funds to the new account in order to get the discount, and then immediately transferring the funds back after closing ( manipulating the process ) and winning jumbo loan business.

"To earn our business over other banks, the Wells Fargo representative assured us that if we took out a loan with them, they would eliminate any prepayment penalty for refinancing with Wells Fargo or making early payments. This information was included in the agreement as instructed by the agent. When we refinanced with Wells Fargo, they charged us over {$100000.00} for a prepayment penalty. To justify their action, they said the new rate would replenish this amount in a short period. I was extremely upset, but with no recourse. I especially told them that going forward, under no circumstance, could they charge me again for prepayment penalty. The agent instructed me, as he had done before, to write this agreement, which I did. A few years later, I paid off the loan, but to my shock, I was charged a prepayment penalty of over {$50000.00}. I was furious, and confronted the loan agent admitted they made a mistake, and I should not have been charged a prepayment penalty. They said they would send a new contract excluding the prepayment penalty. When I received the new contract, I noticed they had removed the prepayment penalty and replaced it with repricing for the same penalty amount. I had never heard of this term or been told that they could charge me for repricing. To this date, they can not explain why they changed the wording to "" repricing.
